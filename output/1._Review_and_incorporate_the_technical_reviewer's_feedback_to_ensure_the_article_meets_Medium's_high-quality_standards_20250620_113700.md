# What is SSO and build with NestJS: A Comprehensive Technical Guide

Single Sign-On (SSO) is an authentication process that allows a user to access multiple applications with one set of login credentials. This guide will explore what SSO is, why it matters, and how you can implement it in a NestJS application.

---

## What is SSO?

SSO simplifies the login process for users, reducing the need to remember multiple passwords. By consolidating authentication processes, organizations can enhance security and improve user experience.

> "SSO not only enhances user experience but also centralizes authentication management, reducing potential security risks."

---

## Benefits of SSO

- **Improved User Experience**: Users access multiple services with a single login.
- **Reduced Password Fatigue**: Less forgotten passwords mean fewer helpdesk calls.
- **Increased Security**: Centralized authentication reduces risk across multiple apps.
- **Easier Compliance**: Simplifies user access audit processes and ensures regulations are met.

---

## Understanding OIDC and OAuth2

Before we jump into the implementation, it's essential to understand the protocols that typically power SSO: OpenID Connect (OIDC) and OAuth2.

### What is OAuth2?

OAuth2 is a framework for delegated access, allowing applications to obtain limited access to user accounts on an HTTP service.

### What is OpenID Connect?

OpenID Connect is an authentication layer on top of OAuth2 that enables clients to verify the identity of users based on the authentication performed by an authorization server.

---

## Use Case: Implementing SSO with NestJS

### Prerequisites

- Node.js installed
- NestJS CLI (`npm i -g @nestjs/cli`)
- A basic NestJS application already set up

### Step 1: Installing Required Packages

Use the following commands to install the required packages:

```bash
npm install @nestjs/passport passport passport-openidconnect
npm install @nestjs/jwt passport-jwt
```

### Step 2: Setting Up Authentication

Create an authentication module to handle the SSO process.

```typescript
// auth/auth.module.ts
import { Module } from '@nestjs/common';
import { AuthService } from './auth.service';

@Module({
  providers: [AuthService],
})
export class AuthModule {}
```

### Step 3: Implementing OpenID Connect

Now, implement the OpenID Connect strategy using Passport.

```typescript
// auth/strategies/openid.strategy.ts
import { Injectable } from '@nestjs/common';
import { PassportStrategy } from '@nestjs/passport';
import { Strategy } from 'passport-openidconnect';

@Injectable()
export class OpenIdConnectStrategy extends PassportStrategy(Strategy, 'openid') {
  constructor() {
    super({
      baseURL: 'https://your-identity-provider.com',
      clientID: 'your-client-id',
      clientSecret: 'your-client-secret',
      redirectUri: 'http://localhost:3000/auth/callback',
      scope: 'openid profile',
    });
  }

  // implement validate method
}
```

### Step 4: Setting up Controllers

Create a controller to handle authentication routes.

```typescript
// auth/auth.controller.ts
import { Controller, Get, Req, Res } from '@nestjs/common';

@Controller('auth')
export class AuthController {
  @Get('login')
  async login(@Res() res) {
    // Redirect to identity provider
  }

  @Get('callback')
  async callback(@Req() req) {
    // Handle the callback from the identity provider
  }
}
```

---

## Testing the Implementation

To test the implementation, run your NestJS app using:

```bash
npm run start
```

Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/auth/login` to initiate the SSO process. Ensure you set up a Client application correctly with your Identity Provider.

---

## Conclusion

Implementing SSO with NestJS can greatly enhance user experience and security. You can further customize and handle various scenarios such as session management, persistent logins, and integrating with third-party authentication providers.
